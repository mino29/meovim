# neovim_config

## Intro

These are my personal neovim config files, currently it only works on my windows 11 machine. 
I'll be trying out macOS and linux with the same config really soon, so hopefully I can get 
the same config on various machines.

## Structure

I separated my neovim config files into various files: the base init.vim, basic (neo)vim config,
my custom keymappings and plugin configs.

This structure and most of the configs are from the ever so popular ultiamte vimrc, it has many
quality of life configs, but some of them are not suited for my personal use. Plus the classic 
vim is so slow compared to neovim. So I have to manually migrate to neovim and do a lot of tweaks 
myself.

## Disclaimer

This is still a work in progress, many parts can still be broken, also I'm not a professional 
programmer, I'm more of a vim hobbiest and casual programmer. So if you find my code to be a mess,
all constructive critisism are welcomed.

Finally, English is not my native language, if you find typos and grammar errors, please let me know.
